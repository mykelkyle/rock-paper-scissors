The Odin Project Foundations (Rock Paper Scissors)

In this project I implemented

- for loops
- functions & variables
- retrieving a random item from an array
- nested if conditionals

Some challenges I faced

- how to properly "nest" if conditionals and also forgetting the difference between assignment operators and comparison operators (= vs. == vs. ===)
- figuring out how to make user input "case-insensitive" (.toLowerCase)
- keeping track of the score and also announcing a winner at the end of the loop (concatenating the player score and the player score message)

Rock Paper Scissors Revisited (Adding UI and DOM manipulation)

In this project I implemented

- event listeners
- DOM methods (selectors/element creation/appending)
- refactoring of code to work with a UI

Some challenges I faced

- felt like end result was bloated and could be trimmed down (esp with JS and CSS)
  for example, I made individual event listeners for buttons but it might have been possible to iterate that somehow...
- still having some trouble with CSS (flexbox)
- wanted to implement some responsive features like hover or onclick animations but found it too difficult
