# rock-paper-scissors

The Odin Project Foundations (Rock Paper Scissors)

In this project I implemented

- for loops
- functions & variables
- retrieving a random item from an array
- nested if conditionals

Some challenges I faced

- how to properly "nest" if conditionals and also forgetting the difference between assignment operators and comparison operators (= vs. == vs. ===)
- figuring out how to make user input "case-insensitive" (.toLowerCase)
- keeping track of the score and also announcing a winner at the end of the loop (concatenating the player score and the player score message)
